## Description

This project analyzes flooding claims data using USGS gage discharge data and log-Pearson III analysis to determine 100-year flood events and their relationship to insurance claims.

## Data Files

### Outputs/

**Q100Final.mat**
- Final table with discharge 100-yr+ events determined from log-Pearson III analysis
- Generated by `LogPearson3Analysis.m` code

**Q100Gages.mat**
- List of all gages with a 100-yr+ event determined from log-Pearson III analysis
- Generated by `LogPearson3Analysis.m` code

**keptGages.mat**
- Dataset with all the watershed information for gages with sufficient data to perform log-Pearson III analysis
- Generated by `LogPearson3Analysis.m` code

**goodClaims.mat**
- Dataset with all claims with sufficient information to perform analysis
- These claims occur inside a USGS gage watershed with discharge data for the date of the claim
- Generated by `FindingClaimsAndPoliciesWithGageInfo.m` code

**goodPolicies.mat**
- Dataset with all policies with sufficient information to perform analysis
- These policies occur inside a USGS gage watershed with discharge data for the year the policy was active
- Generated by `FindingClaimsAndPoliciesWithGageInfo.m` code

**analyzedClaims.mat**
- Dataset with a new field, "causedBy100yr", indicating if a claim was due to pluvial flooding (0) or a 100-yr+ event (1)
- Generated by `AnalyzingClaims.m` code

## Scripts

- `main.py` - Main data processing script
- `mat_data_handler.py` - Handles .mat file loading and conversion to pandas DataFrames
